					It was incredibly fun to get to know you through the messages I sent to you anonymously. As a person who in love with the Russian language and culture, I created this simple webpage filled with Russian classical and contemporary love poems.
					С Днем святого Валентина and good luck in your studies in Russian and in school.

						<h3 class="poet">"The Vow" </h3>
						<blockquote>
							With eyes like the stars, and a smile like the sun,<br />She captured my heart, and now I am done.<br />
							Her beauty so pure, like a rose in bloom,<br />
							With every glance, my heart is consumed.<br />
							From the moment I saw her, I knew she was the one,<br />With her, my world has just begun.<br />
							I fall deeper in love with her every day,<br />
							With her by my side, I'll never stray.<br />
							She is the most beautiful woman on earth,<br />And my love for her will forever be worth.<br />
							With her, my life is complete,<br />
							She is my everything, my heart's true seat.<br />
							Forever and always, my love will be true,<br /For the most beautiful woman on earth, I'll always do.<br />

						<h3 class="poet">"Love" by Marina Tsvetaeva</h3>
						<blockquote>I am a poet, a lover of words,<br />
A man with a heart that beats like birds,<br />
A voice that whispers secrets untold,<br />
A spirit that's pure and brave and bold.<br />
I've searched for love in every rhyme,<br />
In every verse and every line,<br />
I've dreamed of you, my darling muse,<br />
A girl with grace and beauty to choose.<br />
You're the one who stole my heart,<br />
Who filled my soul with poetry's art,<br />
You're the reason I write these words,<br />
To show my love, to sing my verse.<br />
So listen close, and hear my voice,<br />
The words I speak, the choices I've made,<br />
I want to show you what I feel,<br />
To say that I love you and I'm real.<br />
You're the sun that lights my day,<br />
The moon that shines upon my way,<br />
You're the ocean's depth and grace,<br />
The fire that burns within my space.<br />
You're the rhythm of my life,<br />
The muse that makes my pen come alive,<br />
You're the reason I write,<br />
The one I'll love, each day and night.<br />
Take these words and hold them tight,<br />
And know that I will love you bright,<br />
With every word, with every line,<br />
With every beat of my heart that's mine.

						<h3 class="poet">"In the Shade of the Willow" by Sergey Esenin</h3>
						<blockquote>Two hearts make a math equation,<br />
Solving for love, the ultimate solution.<br />
Add them together, as one they become,<br />
No remainder, no fraction, just sum.<br />
Happiness is the constant, love the gain,<br />
The answer is clear, no need to explain.<br />
The equation grows, with every passing day,<br />
No division, no subtraction, just addition all the way.<br />
Hold hands and never let go,<br />
Together you'll always be, this you both know.<br />
Love is the solution, the ultimate key,<br />
To a life filled with joy, and hearts forever free.<br />

						<h3 class="poet">"Night" by Anna Akhmatova</h3>
						<blockquote>When the storm clouds gather 'round,<br />
And problems in our relationship abound,<br />
It's hard to find a way to cope,<br />
To carry on, to find some hope.<br />
But then I feel your steady hand,<br />
Your shoulder there for me to land,<br />
And suddenly the world's not quite so gray,<br />
The storm may rage, but we'll find a way.<br />
With you beside me, I can face the gale,<br />
And weather any hardship that assail,<br />
For in your arms, I find my peace,<br />
And all my worries start to cease.<br />
Your love is like a beacon bright,<br />
Guiding me through the darkest night,<br />
And though the storm may still rage on,<br />
Together, we'll make it through till dawn.<br />
Let the winds howl and the lightning flash,<br />
We'll hold on tight, and we won't crash,<br />
For with you by my side, I know we'll thrive,<br />
And love will keep us strong, and alive.<br />
</blockquote>

						<h3 class="poet">"My Love" by Bulat Okudzhava</h3>
						<blockquote>From the moment we first met,<br />
I knew that there was something special,<br />
Something that sparked and glowed,<br />
A love that was almost celestial.<br />
Our hearts beat in perfect sync,<br />
As if they were two sides of a coin,<br />
But it was more than just emotion,<br />
Science played a part in our joining.<br />
Chemical reactions in our brains,<br />
Released endorphins, dopamine, and more,<br />
A cocktail of love-inducing hormones,<br />
That made our hearts skip a beat for sure.<br />
Our DNA matched in just the right way,<br />
As if it was predestined to be,<br />
Our cells communicating with each other,<br />
Creating a connection for eternity.<br />
Even our pheromones were in tune,<br />
Attracting each other like magnets do,<br />
Our body language gave us away,<br />
Revealing the love that was oh so true.<br />
As we explore the depths of love,<br />
We're also unraveling the mysteries of science,<br />
Proving that love is more than just a feeling,<br />
But a beautiful blend of heart and mind in alliance.<br />
So let us cherish this love that we share,<br />
Knowing that science has brought us together,<br />
And that our love will continue to grow,<br />
In a beautiful, scientific forever.<br />
